### 💼 My Experiences

<p>
    <strong><a href="https://github.com/Temirlan504/Percy">Capstone Project - Mars Rover Replica</a></strong><br>
    One of my significant achievements during my coursework was leading a capstone project where I managed a team to develop a Perseverance Mars Rover replica. This project involved utilizing a Raspberry Pi 4 as a Web Server, integrating an ADC module through I2C communication, PWM generation for the motors, and designing a power circuit to support the rover’s functionality. The software part included integration and development of a Web Application using Python to receive a live video from the rover's camera. Moreover, the Web Page included virtual controls for the motors that used JavaScript, HTML, and CSS on the Front-end. The project emphasized my ability to independently manage project priorities and deadlines, demonstrating both my technical and project management skills.

    <strong>Back-end Web Developer Intern at NGS</strong><br>
    In my role as a Back-end Web Developer intern at NGS, I developed automated test scripts using Python, collaborated closely with the development team, and utilized source control systems like Git. This experience allowed me to develop strong problem-solving and analytical skills, which are crucial for optimizing system resources and ensuring efficient, stable, and scalable firmware.

<p>
    <strong>Field Placement at General Motors</strong><br>
    At General Motors, I completed an 80-hour field placement where I gained industry knowledge in industrial automation and robotics programming. I also developed a SharePoint website for maintenance personnel, and demonstrated organizational skills while collecting safety documents and digitizing them to then email to my supervisor.
